# SSSD vs Winbind: Choosing Your Identity Layer

There’s a schism in the Linux + AD integration world. SSSD and Winbind both work — but serve different purposes.

| Feature | SSSD | Winbind |
|--------|------|---------|
| Modern Kerberos support | ✅ | ✅ |
| Uses PAM stack | ✅ | ✅ |
| AD Group membership resolution | ✅ | ✅ |
| Seamless home directory support | ✅ | ❌ |

In most cases, SSSD offers cleaner configs and better systemd integration. Winbind, however, is still the fallback for niche Samba features.
