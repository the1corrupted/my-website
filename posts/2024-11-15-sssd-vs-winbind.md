# SSSD vs Winbind: The Real Story

Let’s cut through the idealism — **SSSD kinda sucks** when it comes to multi-purpose identity governance and Samba ACL integration. Here’s why:

- **SSSD** offers modern Kerberos support and decent group/user mappings, but starts falling apart when you need deep ACL control or reliable file share integration.
- **Winbind** might be older and messier, but it works. Broad compatibility, better Samba support, and less drama.

## What They Both Do

| Feature                      | SSSD ✅ | Winbind ✅ |
|-----------------------------|---------|------------|
| AD authentication           | ✅       | ✅          |
| Kerberos ticketing          | ✅       | ✅          |
| Group/user control mapping  | ✅       | ✅          |

## What Breaks the Tie

Winbind:
- Just works with complex `smb.conf`
- Supports native ACLs in enterprise setups
- Often better for file server roles

SSSD:
- Easier config for login-only systems
- Cleaner systemd support
- Feels modern, but brittle under load

In the end, pick your poison — but if you're mixing file sharing with identity, **Winbind is the more dependable (if uglier) option**.
